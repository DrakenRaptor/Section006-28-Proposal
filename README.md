# Section006-28-Proposal

GOALS 

Our team goals for this project are: 
To make predictions on a specific kind of data set 
To complete the project by the set deadline. 
To use our combined expertise to produce a high-quality project. 
To improve communication skills and teamwork ability throughout the whole process of making the project. 
To make human-readable analysis and reasonable prediction on a given data set. 
To develop a user-friendly, well-documented project. 
To use our knowledge of loading, tidying, wrangling, summarizing, and visualizing that we have learnt in DSCI 100 in this project.  
We also aim to appropriately answer a predictive question 
 

We wish to accomplish:  
Formulating and answering a predictive question on the ?iris dataset using classification.  
the fact to analyze the set of regression on the iris dataset as found in R when obtaining the dataset from Machine Learning Repository Links to an external site..   
Skills we want to develop and refine:  
We wish to refine our skills in producing the standard deviation, and regression of a particular dataset using the R Language as compared to analyzing on Microsoft Excel. 
We wish to refine our communication skills by working as a team on this project. 
We wish to refine our skills in using R. 
 

 

 

EXPECTATIONS:  

We expect one another:  
To do their parts of the project in a timely manner so that it is fair.  
To respect each otherâ€™s ideas and opinions on the project.  
To ensure we exchange criticism which is constructive.  
To help each other so that we can create a high-quality project.  
To be in contact throughout the project working period. 
Report any sudden issues that make one cannot be on the teamwork for a period.  
 

  

POLICIES & PROCEDURES:  

We will try:  

Communicate with each other before making any changes. 
Start early and prioritize certain tasks that are more doable first, before proceeding to tackle the challenging tasks. 
To set deadlines together so it is clear when each of the teammates will be finishing their parts. 
Each change that is made to the project document should be backed up. 
Get a grasp of everyone's schedules and personal commitments ahead of time to convene when necessary to discuss what is required for us to do on our own part to produce the different sets of analyses for our own dataset. 
 

 

CONSEQUENCES 

We address the non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies, and procedures by:  
If one of us is not able to cooperate and adhere to their responsibilities, their name will not be added to the project.  
Their behaviour will be reported to TAs and professors.
